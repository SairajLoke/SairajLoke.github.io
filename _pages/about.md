<div class="about_image">

  I am a 3rd year Undergraduate, studying Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IIT Indore).
  <br>
  <br>
  Working in robot perception and planning with the team at <a href="https://www.autonomousrobotslab.com/"  style="font-family: inherit;color: blue;" >NTNU-Autonomous Robotics Lab, Norway </a> under guidance of <a href="http://www.kostasalexis.com/" style="font-family: inherit;color: blue;">Prof.Kostas Alexis </a>

  <br>
  I will be joining <a href="https://usys.ethz.ch/en/people/profile.MjczNjI4.TGlzdC8yODUyLDMyMDE5NzIyMg==.html" style="font-family: inherit;color: blue;"> Prof. Stefano Mintchev's Environmental Robotics Lab </a> at ETH Zurich, to work on "Visual Estimation of Tree Canopy Rigidity" this Fall-2024 supported by the Swissnex ThinkSwiss Scholarship.

  <br>
  I have prevously worked under guidance of <a href="https://www.iiti.ac.in/people/~artiwari/" style="font-family: inherit;color: blue;">Prof. Aruna Tiwari </a> for Data Augmentation using GANs.

  <br>
  <br>
  My interest lies at the intersection of Robotics and Computer Vision to make better machine perception and thereby making informed control decisions for achieving a given downstream goal, such as autonomous navigation.
  
  <br>
  Currently the Chair of IEEE-RAS IIT Indore Chapter, Ex-Head of Autonomy Division IVDC student club.
