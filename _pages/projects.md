## Reed:  An approach towards quickly bootstrapping multilingual acoustic models

<span class="research-text">
Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have led to a major step forward towards building robust ASR systems for languages with low resource availability by increasing coverage for individual languages. State of the art multilingual systems are developed with sequential networks such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture long term temporal dependencies. Training and inference in such sequential models are computationally expensive, which poses a significant challenge in terms of scalability and real-time applications. In this work, an alternate architecture based on short term contextual temporal features learned on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a non-sequential discriminative network is proposed. Three low resource Indic languages, Gujarati, Tamil, and Telugu are used to ascertain that our proposed architecture trains 5.5× faster and reduces the inference time by a factor of 26 while maintaining comparable word error rates (WERs) against our baseline RNN.</span>

## Knowledge Graph Based Attachment Suggestions

In this paper we present AiGraph, an enterprise knowledge graph, representing details about how an employee communicates through emails, meetings, and documents. By representing all her communication in the form of a graph, we are able to extract complex insights which are computationally expensive in silo’ed applications. We consider a recommendation application – Meeting Insights – to show power of AiGraph. This application recommends related emails and documents for a given meeting. There are a number of ways in which AiGraph can improve the Meeting Insights – most signifcantly, it can improve the relevance of the system by providing better candidate emails; and features for a ranker to rank these candidates. In this paper we describe various ways to improve relevance of Meeting Insights using AiGraph.</span>
